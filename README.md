## Project Setup

To build and run the project, follow these steps:

* Clone the repository.
* Create multiple databases and change the db properties files inside the directory `alltenants` accordingly.
* One tenant must be declared as default. Change the properties `tenant.default` in `application.properties` to set a
  tenant as default.
* To run the `scheduler-service` create a table named tenant. <br>
  `create table tenant
  (
      id           bigint generated by default as identity primary key,
      name         varchar(20) unique not null,
      company_name varchar(50)        not null
  );` <br>
  Insert all the tenants information in the table. `name` should be the `tenant-name`.
* Run the Project.
